# Portfolio project 1

## Personal Website Project

 This is my first project with the learning people. this project is to show the skills i have learnt so far.
this website is designed to be the starting point in my developer journey Where future would be employers can check out some of my latest projects.
## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* GitHub/Git
* bootstrap
* flexbox

# Features

* ## Home page 
On my home page i wanted to keep the theme across the site to be as minimal as possible. although i dont have many projects and experiece yet i wanted to show that i can develop good design with a minimalist approach. image of myself along side the nav bar and footer is what i went for with this.

* ## Nav bar
The nav bar is just a simple easy to use design to match the theme of the webiste. within the nav bar i decided to create a drop down section for the future projects i will develop.

* ## Footer 
Simple and easy to navigate footer that is designed to reach out and contact me through social media platforms or by email. included some mild animatiuon to enlarge the icon you hover over. Again keeping the minimal design flow.

* ## Contact Form

Designed a contact form so that if people dont wnat to contact me through social media they can submit a form to contact me. whike this feature is not fully functioning right now i can fix this in the future when the time is right

* ## Social side bar
Created a animated side bar for my contact page. when you hover over the selected social link a small animation happens. although i already have a footer with this detail included i liked the design of this so included it within the contact me section of the website.
